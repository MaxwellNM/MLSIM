##  Max Learning Style Identification Model  (MLSIM) 

### Felder & Silverman Learning Style Dimension :
  - Active/Reflective, 
  - Sensitive/Intuitive, 
  - Visual/Verbal, 
  - Sequential/Global)


### Classes :

  - extraction.py:  Extract and select learning traces in the virtual learning environent
  - preprocess.py : load data from the virtual learning environment and Ipute data for trainining
  - parameters.py : Define the parameters of the model and training options
  - optimize_params.py : process hyperparameterization to train the model 
  - main.py : To test the model

### Folders :
  - data : contains data of each learning style dimension
  - model : Define the architecture of the built model
  - notebook : To Extact and Visualize data from learning traces selection

  - CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks (See [dev branch](https://github.com/yusugomori/DeepLearning/tree/dev).)
